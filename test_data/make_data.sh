# This script reproduces all save-analysis data in the test_data directories.

# TODO currently this is broken. Cargo makes files of the form deps/save-analysis/foo-....json
# now and you need to manually trim the -... before copying. Could probably fix
# this script with a regex or something to handle that, but I don't have the script-fu.

# Data for rls-analysis. This is essentially a bootstrap. Be careful when using
# this data because the source is not pinned, therefore the data will change
# regualarly. It should basically just be used as a 'big'-ish set of real-world
# data for smoke testing.
